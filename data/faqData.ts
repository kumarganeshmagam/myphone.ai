    question: 'Which phone brand suits me best?',
    answer: 'The "best" brand is subjective and depends on your priorities. Apple (iOS) is known for its seamless ecosystem, user-friendliness, and strong privacy. Samsung (Android) offers premium features and a wide range of devices. Google Pixel (Android) excels in camera software and provides a clean Android experience. Brands like OnePlus offer flagship-level specs at a more competitive price.',

    question: 'How much RAM and Storage do I need?',
    answer: 'For most users, 8GB of RAM is the sweet spot for smooth multitasking. If you\'re a heavy gamer or power user, 12GB is better. For storage, 128GB is a good starting point, but if you take lots of photos and videos, consider 256GB or more to avoid running out of space.',

    question: 'Is a high-refresh-rate display (90Hz/120Hz) worth it?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. A higher refresh rate makes scrolling, animations, and gaming feel incredibly smooth and fluid. Once you experience a 120Hz display, it\'s hard to go back to a standard 60Hz screen. It\'s one of the most noticeable upgrades in modern smartphones.',

  {
    question: 'What\'s the real difference between AMOLED and LCD screens?',
    answer: 'AMOLED screens offer vibrant colors, deeper blacks (by turning off individual pixels), and better contrast, which also makes them more power-efficient for dark mode. LCD screens are typically cheaper to produce and can sometimes achieve higher peak brightness, but generally can\'t match the color depth of AMOLED.',

  {
    question: 'How important are software updates?',
    answer: 'Very important. Regular software and security updates protect your phone from vulnerabilities and ensure you get the latest features. Google and Apple typically offer the longest and most consistent support (5-7 years), with brands like Samsung also providing excellent long-term update policies (4-5 years).',
